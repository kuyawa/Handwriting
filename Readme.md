# Swift AI - Handwriting for iOS

This is a port from Swift 2.2 to 3.0 of the extraordinary job done by **Collin Hundley** in his amazing project [Swift-AI](https://github.com/Swift-AI/Swift-AI)

All merit goes to Collin, I did absolutely nothing, just clicked "Convert" and spent three hours clicking on over eight hundred red dots everywhere to dismiss warnings and accept conversions to the new syntax.

This is a basic but beautiful example of how Machine Learning can be used to train computers to perform complex tasks like handwriting, speech, image recognition and much more.

There are more examples in his repo but I just wanted to play with handwriting recognition to get my feet wet in AI.

Stay tuned for a conversion to Swift 3.1 using his new release in Swift AI 2.0
