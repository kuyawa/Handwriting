# Swift AI - Handwriting for iOS

This is a port from Swift 2.2 to 3.0 of the extraordinary job done by **Collin Hundley** in his amazing project [Swift-AI](https://github.com/Swift-AI/Swift-AI)

I did absolutely nothing, just clicked "Convert" and spent three hours clicking on over eight hundred red dots everywhere to dismiss warnings and accept conversions to the new syntax.

It is a basic but beautiful example of how Machine Learning can be used to train computers to perform complex tasks like handwriting, speech, image recognition and much more.

Stay tuned for a conversion to Swift 3.1 using his new release in Swift AI 2.0
